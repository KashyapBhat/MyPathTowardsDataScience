## Conda Environment setup

If the conda command says conda command not found, Most probably the anaconda path is not set.
To set the path, Do:

1. Find your installed anaconda3 folder and move it to /Users/MY_USER_NAME/

2. Open Terminal

3. Enter: export PATH='/Users/MY_USER_NAME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH'

4. Enter: conda init zsh

It should get the job done.
